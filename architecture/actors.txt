Relationships:
organization HAS user
delivery HAS events


Process:
    user:
    1. Register as user
    2. Login
    3. Register a delivery.json object to be tracked
    4. Starts tracking

    carrier:
    1. Register as a carrier
    2. Login
    3. create tracking events for delivery.json and update the current edge. 
        when tracking evenets are being created, the carrier also provide whether 
        the shipment has reached the end of the edge or not. If yes it will move 
        the current edge for a delivery to next. If there is no next, it means we
        have passed all the edges and the shipment is at the final destination and
        is marked as shipped. 

    
    A: Every 10 minutes go and grab stuff from carriers that provide tracking API
    B: Rerouting: in an event of mishaps or shortcuts we want to be able to re-generate delivery.json
